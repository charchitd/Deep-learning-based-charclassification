Problem Statement:-

Generate 32 cross 32 pixel Images, 1000 each for 10 characters[0,1,2...9] and for 26 Alphabets[A,B........Z] using ImageMagick's "convert" function by writing code in Python_Script(not using command line directly).

1.Images in this synthetic dataset should have random backgrounds. The backgrounds for each character should be selected randomly from the 100 background images downloaded in the previous steps. 
2.Characters in this synthetic dataset should be rendered using different randomly selected fonts. You can download fonts from Google Fonts. Use 25 of these fonts. 
3.The characters should be rendered with an arbitrary warp.
4.Add a random amount of blur and noise to the training images. The amount of blur should not be very high to make the character unreadable. 


Using the 36000 images generated,use 80% for training purpose and 20% for test data.

Now,using CNN, train the network.
